# Git-in-Scala
Building a basic version control system similar to Git in Scala


### Project Overview:
The *gittu* project is being developed using **two programming languages**: **Scala** and **Go**. The team chose these languages to deepen our understanding of both functional and concurrent programming paradigms. Scala’s functional capabilities combined with the JVM ecosystem are well-suited for complex data analysis, while Go’s simplicity and excellent support for concurrent programming make it perfect for building high-performance and scalable applications.
